My research interests include statistical methodology for causal inference and its applications in public health and the social sciences. I am particularly interested in integrating machine learning methods for causal inference.\nBefore joining the University of Washington’s Biostatistics PhD program, I studied at Peking University, where I double-majored in preventive medicine and economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured papers\n\nWang, R., Zhao, Y., Dukes, O., Zhang, B.
